# cellular_matrix_multiprocessing

The program will take an input matrix, split it into a number of chunks to be processed concurrently, and then write a final matrix to an output file.

This program demonstrates:
  Cellular Automata Simulation
  Matrix Operations and Neighbor Analysis
  Parallel Processing with Python Multiprocessing
  Boundary Management for Parallel Processing
  Command Line Argument Parsing
  Matrix Input and Output Handling
  Rule-Based State Transitions
  Code Modularity
